# SMS-Analysis

This project is a personal project I started back in Summer or Fall of 2016 when I was just learning python. I started with this idea to gain concrete experience manipulating data to do fun things. I don't know if this is the best way to learn, but it seems fun.

My goal is to see what interesting things I can do with a backlog of my text messages. I will see what statistical analysis I can apply. I'm definitely open to ideas. I hope to use this to practice with Machine Learning, as free text data is a good way to do that.

## Getting Started

Coming soon.

As of writing, there are more bits that haven't been commited, including the data that I've been working with. Eventually I'll have dummy text data in the same form as I used.

### Prerequisites

Coming soon...

This code is not smart. It currently takes data in a specific format as created by this SMS Backup app:

I'll get it so loading the data is as simple as naming the file a certain something, or creating an interface to select the path from a GUI Explorer window at program runtime. If that's a good idea...

Otherwise, it uses a vanilla installation of Anaconda with all packages up to date.
